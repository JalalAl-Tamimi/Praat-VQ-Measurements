The script "VQ_measurements.praat" provides multiple acoustic measures to Voice Quality (VQ). It uses the Two-pass method for estimation f0 range adapted to each speaker; uses the cross-correlation method. The measurements are:
1. Jitter and Shimmer (various measures)
2. Harmonics to Noise Ratio (HNR); full, between 0-500 Hz, 0-1500 Hz, 0-2500 Hz and 0-3500 Hz
3. Many of the Acoustic Breathiness Index: Energy components, spectral tilt and slope, glottal excitation, hammarberg Index, band energy differences, and cepstral peak prominence.

The script uses a Sound file and a TextGrid. A results file is outputted.
